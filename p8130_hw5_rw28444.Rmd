# Problem 1

For this problem you will use dataset ‘Antibodies.csv’ from homework 1. In the first assignment
you generated descriptive statistics and exploratory plots for the Ig-M levels by Normal vs Altered
groups. The conclusion was that Ig-M distributions were both right skewed with higher levels for
the Altered group.
Given the non-normal distributions, now you are asked to use an alternative, non-parametric test
to assess and comment on the difference in Ig-M levels between the two groups (please ignore
unanswered and missing values). You can use R to perform the calculations, but make sure you
state test that you used, the hypotheses, test statistic, p-value and provide interpretation in the
context of the problem.


```{r igm_clean}
igm_df <- read.csv("./data/Antibodies.csv")


igm_df = 
  igm_df %>% 
  mutate(
    AgeCategory = as.factor(AgeCategory),
    Smell = as.factor(Smell),
    Gender = as.factor(Gender)
  )

my_labels <- list(AgeCategory = "Age(yrs)", Antibody_IgM = "IgM", Smell="Smell", Gender="Gender")
my_controls <- tableby.control(
               total = F,
               test=F,
               numeric.stats = c("meansd", "medianq1q3", "range", "Nmiss2"),
               cat.stats = c("countpct", "Nmiss2"),
               stats.labels = list(
               meansd = "Mean (SD)",
               medianq1q3 = "Median/IQR",
               range = "Min - Max",
               Nmiss2 = "Missing",
               countpct = "N (%)"))

tab1 <- tableby(Smell ~  Antibody_IgM, data = igm_df, control=my_controls)
summary(tab1, title = "Descriptive Statistics: Antibodies Data", labelTranslations = my_labels, text=T) %>% 
  knitr::kable()


rank_sum_norm = 
  igm_df %>%
  filter(Smell == "Normal") %>% 
  drop_na() %>% 
  select(Antibody_IgM)

rank_sum_alter = 
  igm_df %>% 
  filter(Smell == "Altered") %>%
  drop_na() %>% 
  select(Antibody_IgM)

qqnorm(rank_sum_norm$Antibody_IgM, main = "Q-Q Plot for Normal group")
qqnorm(rank_sum_alter$Antibody_IgM, main = "Q-Q Plot for Altered group")
  
  
n_1 = count(rank_sum_norm)
n_2 = count(rank_sum_alter)
```


From the descriptive statistic and the qq-plots above, we can see that the IgM between two groups are skewed and un-paired. So I decided to use non-parametric method ---- Wilcoxon Rank-Sum test.

Let $T_{1}$ be the sum of the ranks of the IgM levels of the Normal group, and let $T_{2}$ be the levels of the Altered group.

And the hypotheses to be tested are:

$H_0:$ the medians of the two groups are equal.
$H_1:$ the medians of the two groups are not equal.

And the $T_{stat}$:
$$
\begin{align}
T_{stat} = \frac{\left|T_{1}-\frac{n_{1}\left(n_{1}+n_{2}+1\right)}{2}\right|-\frac{1}{2}}{\sqrt{\left(n_{1} n_{2} / 12\right)\left(n_{1}+n_{2}+1\right)}}\\
\end{align}
$$
And if ties:\\
$$
\begin{align}
T_{stat}=\frac{\left|T_{1}-\frac{n_{1}\left(n_{1}+n_{2}+1\right)}{2}\right|-\frac{1}{2}}{\sqrt{\left(n_{1} n_{2} / 12\right)\left[\left(n_{1}+n_{2}+1\right)-\sum_{i=1}^{g} t_{i}\left(t_{i}^{2}-1\right) /\left(n_{1}+n_{2}\right)\left(n_{1}+n_{2}-1\right)\right]}}\\
\end{align}
$$
where $t_i$ refers to the number of observations with the same absolute value in the $i^{th}$ group and $g$ is the number of tied groups.

```{r wilcoxon_rank_sum}
non_para_test =
  wilcox.test(rank_sum_norm$Antibody_IgM, rank_sum_alter$Antibody_IgM,mu = 0) %>% 
  broom::tidy()
```

**Decision Rules:**

Under normal-approximation:$n_1~and~n_2\geq10$ , where $n_1 = `r n_1`$, and $n_2 = `r n_2`$.

Reject $H_0$ if $T_{stat}>z_{1-\alpha/2}$.

P-value = \( 2 \times [1-\Phi(T_{stat})] \)

In our situation, \(T_{stat} =`r non_para_test$statistic`>z_{0.975}=`r qnorm(0.975)` \), and p-value is \(`r non_para_test$p.value`\). We reject the null hypothesis and conclude that the medians of the Normal and Altered smell categories are not equal (using a 0.05 significant level). 




# Problem 2 

Formulate can be handwritten - legibly – scanned and incorporated into the HW PDF.
Consider the simple linear regression model:
𝑌𝑖 = 𝛽0 + 𝛽1𝑋𝑖 + 𝜀𝑖 , 𝜀𝑖~𝑁(0, 𝜎2).
1. Derive the maximum likelihood estimates for 𝛽0 and 𝛽1. (10p)
Hint: Start by writing the likelihood/log-likelihood function, take the first derivatives and set
them equal to zero (see course slides). No need to show that the pair of estimates is a global
point (i.e., no second derivatives are required).
2. The ‘estimated errors’ of the model are called residuals and denoted by 𝑒𝑖 = 𝑌𝑖 − 𝑌𝑖 ̂ .
Show that the sum of the residuals is zero: Σ 𝑒𝑖 = 0 𝑛𝑖
=1 . (5p)


# Problem 3

The director of admissions of a small college selected 120 students at random from the new
freshman class in a study to determine whether a student’s GPA at the end of the freshman year
(Y) can be predicted from the ACT test score (X). Use data ‘GPA.csv’ to answer the following
questions:
You can use R to perform/check the calculations, but you need to show the formulae where
asked to do so.

1. Generate a scatter plot and test whether a linear association exists between student’s ACT
score (X) and GPA at the end of the freshman year (Y). Use a level of significance of 0.05.
Write the hypotheses, test statistics, critical value and decision rule with interpretation in the
context of the problem. (7.5p)

2. Write the estimated regression line equation in the context of this problem. (2.5p)

3. Obtain a 95% confidence interval for β1. Interpret your confidence interval. Does it include
zero? Why might the director of admissions be interested in whether the confidence interval
includes zero? (2.5p)

4. Obtain a 95% interval estimate of the mean freshman GPA for students whose ACT test score
is 28. Interpret your confidence interval. Hint: Use R function predict(). (2.5p)

5. Anne obtained a score of 28 on the entrance test. Predict her freshman GPA using a 95%
prediction interval. Interpret your prediction interval. Hint: Use R function predict(). (2.5p)
6. Is the prediction interval in part 5) wider than the confidence interval in part 4)? Explain.
